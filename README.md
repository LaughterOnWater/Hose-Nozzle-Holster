## Introduction:
Tired of not knowing where the hose nozzle is?
Where did the last volunteer stow the nozzle? End frustrations!
Create a holster for your hoze nozzle with stuff you probably have.
Now you’ll know where your nozzle is when it’s not on the hose.
This works with the Gilmour 528 Solid Brass Twist Nozzle pictured right.

Directions for creating the holster are on page 3 of the pdf.
