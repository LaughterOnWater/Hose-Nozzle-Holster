Create a holster for your hoze nozzle. 
Know where the nozzle is when itâ€™s not on the hose.

Print this template on Bristol Board, Oaktag or a similarly durable cardboard.Print this at its original size -- do not print to fit.Cut out the template and use it to mark your carwash tunnel cloth.
Use a 1/8th inch hole punch for the holes.

Use two medium zip ties to secure the holster.

Nail, screw or staple the holster
where you want it to live.

Your nozzle hoster is ready to use.
